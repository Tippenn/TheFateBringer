## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Mechanics I Created
### Generic Grid System

- Logic is located within the `grid.cs` script
- the script is the base of all the grid system inside the game.
- the grid which will then be used for the tilemap and its visualizer.

### Generic Saving System

- Logic is located within the `SaveSytem.cs` script
- JSON file format is used to store essential level data such as the grid layout and the inventory system.
- using other script such as 'UnitSpawner.cs' , 'TileMap.cs' , and 'InventorySystem.cs' the JSON data will be translated to their respected needs.
- the save is located in the folder 'Asset/Resources'

### Inheritance
- the base unit is located in 'UnitGridCombat.cs' script
- the base unit is then used for 2 other script which is 'RobotBaseScript.cs' script and 'GiantBaseScript.cs' script
